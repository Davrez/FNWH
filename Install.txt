This are the manual commands to install the script without error on your terminal

Already with the script stored in your download folder 
You then open termux and type this commands carefully don't rush as I will explain each!

If already granted just skip. 

$ pkg update 

#wait... 

$ pkg upgrade

# wait... 

pkg install pip

$ cd storage/downloads

#This command takes you to your internal download folder

$ cd FNWH 

# Now this command takes you to the script folder ðŸ“‚

$ pip install requests 

#wait till done 

$ pip install tqdm 

#wait Again 

$ pip install termcolor 

# just wait... 

Done! 


[How To Use] 

To use fnwh.py you need a txt file with your urls to scan. 

Just copy/move your host list to (script folder) FNWH Folder in your downloads. 
    And then open termux and type this command
    
$ python3 fnwh.py yourlist.txt

Your results are saved in the same folder with the script as "results"
